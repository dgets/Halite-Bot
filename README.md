# Halite II coding challenge bot submission

I'm getting started on this kind of late, so I probably won't rank very well,
but it's something to get me back into the groove with python.  I've got to
say, even my very first rudimentary bot, it's seeming like I'm going to be
pretty addicted to it, as well.  :)  Not a bad thing; at least it's keeping me
doing something that'll keep the skills from getting rusty.
